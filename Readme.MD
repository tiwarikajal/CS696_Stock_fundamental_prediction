This project aimed at identifying strong textual signals from annual SEC filings- 10K report which could augment fundamental prediction of baseline (linear regression). 


Fundamental here refers to any data which helps determining value of stock like NetIncomeLoss, Revenue, Payments to acquire plant & property etc.


As a result of this project we found that 'Sentiment score' is one such strong textual predictor which when combined with historical data improves over basleline performance.
